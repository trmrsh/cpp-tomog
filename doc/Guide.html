<h1>A Guide to the C++ Doppler tomography programs</h1>
<p>
The C++ Doppler tomography programs are a suite of programs
for generating trailed spectra and Doppler images, and performing
various operations on them.

<p>
To get started, first use <a href="dgen.html">dgen</a> to create
a map. You can use this more than once and then combine the results
with <a href="dadd.html">dadd</a> or <a href="dsub.html">dsub</a> to 
create a more complex map. You can also add constants to the result with
<a href="dadd.html">dadd</a>.

<p>
Once you have a map which you like (check it with 
<a href="dplot.html">dplot</a>), then you can compute
a trailed spectrum from it with <a href="tgen.html">tgen</a>.
You can add noise to this with <a href="tnadd.html">tnadd</a>,
and then invert with <a href="dtmem.html">dtmem</a> (MEM)
or <a href="tfilt.html">tfilt</a> followed by <a href="tback.html">tback</a>
(filtered back-projection).

<p>
Other routines such as <a href="dvar.html">dvar</a>
and <a href="dcor.html">dcor</a> allow you to analyse noise.

<p>
Finally, the file input and output routines recognise '-' as
indicating standard input and output. This allows you to chain
commands together and is often useful. e.g.<br><br>
tnadd test_trail 20 10 0 7971 1 - | tplot -80 /xs<br><br>
which add noise to a trail and then plots it without saving it.
